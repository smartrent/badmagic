# Changelog

## v0.0.19

### Bugfixes

- If you have a dropdown option with a value of `false` it would revert to the `Select One` option (if that existed). Now `false` is handled appropriately and we just check against `null` or `undefined` for reverting back to `Select One`

### Breaking Change

- `Documentation` tab now requires `html` generated by the webpack `markdown-loader` (usually passed through the `html-loader`) whereas before it would take a JS template string that had markdown inside and parse that string

## v0.0.18

### Features

- Keyword search is workspace specific now
- Better object params support: specifying a key of `properties` will infer that the param is an object (see example below)
- A route can have `sticky: true` added to it so that it cannot be filtered with keyword search
- `Documentation` tab is hidden if there is no documentation specified
- Environment variables previously needed to be saved through click of a button, we've removed the button in favor of using the Enter key

#### New Object Support

```javascript
{
  name: "Create User",
  path: "/v1/users",
  method: Method.POST,
  body: [
    {
      name: "user",
      label: "User",
      properties: [
        { name: "first_name", required: true },
        { name: "last_name", required: true },
        { name: "email", required: true },
        { name: "dob", type: "date" },
      ],
    },
  ]
}
```

### Breaking Changes

- Context no longer has support for `setRouteFilter` and `routeFilter` since it's now namespaced to a workspace. Please use `setWorkspaceSearchKeywords(keywords)` and `getWorkspaceSearchKeywords()` instead

### Notes

- We are going to deprecate `json` as a param option in a future version in favor of a param that has `properties`. We will probably need to do something to have stronger array support so we will leave `json` for now

## v0.0.17

### Features

- Mark URL Params as required (note: it will not enforce this currently)
- If there are no QS params, do not include `?` in the request
- Handle non-json Axios 200 responses and non-json error responses

## v0.0.16

### Features

- Add new `documentation` key to routes to provide Markdown documentation to your end-users

## v0.0.15

### Features

- Style refactor using TailwindCSS

## v0.0.14

### Features

- Fixed header for workspaces, search, and env
- Adds ReactJsonView for responses

## v0.0.13

### Features

- Routes collapsed by default
- Inputs have `Set Null` button
- Routes have a reset form button
- Improve Route / Request Spacing

### Bugfixes

- Default values are now applied without requiring a keystroke
